My name is Mina Amin, a first-year Cybersecurity Engineering student at Galala University. I'm deeply passionate about technology, personal growth, and making a meaningful impact in everything I do. Balancing my studies with hands-on experiences like the ALX program and working with my father has helped me stay grounded while pushing forward toward my goals. I'm also working on improving my physical fitness, mental health, and time management to build a strong foundation for both my personal and professional life.

Beyond academics, Iâ€™m an aspiring influencer with a love for creativity and authenticity. I enjoy connecting with people, whether it's through relatable content, offering services like guitar lessons or swimming coaching, or just sharing moments that inspire and motivate. I'm driven by the desire to grow, inspire others, and become the best version of myself.
